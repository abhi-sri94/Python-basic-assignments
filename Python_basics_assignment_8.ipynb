        "\n",
        "Importing PyInputPlus as `pypi` (or any other alias) is a matter of personal preference or convention followed by some developers. It allows for a shorter and more concise way to refer to the PyInputPlus library in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you import a library using the `import` statement, you can provide an alias for that library using the `as` keyword. This alias can be used later in your code to refer to the imported library. For example, `import pyinputplus as pypi` creates an alias pypi for the PyInputPlus library.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using a shorter alias like pypi, you can save typing effort and reduce the amount of code you need to write when accessing the functions and classes provided by the PyInputPlus library.

        "\n",
        "`inputInt()` and `inputFloat()` are not standard functions in the Python programming language. However, assuming you are referring to a hypothetical situation where these functions exist, I can provide some insights on how you might distinguish between them based on common programming practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Function Signature** : In Python, functions are defined with a signature that includes the name of the function and the types of arguments it accepts. If `inputInt()` and `inputFloat()` are distinct functions, they might have different names or parameter types, which would make it clear which one to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Naming Convention** : Programming languages often follow naming conventions that help indicate the purpose or behavior of functions. If `inputInt()` and `inputFloat()` follow such conventions, their names might provide hints about the type of input they expect.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, functions with names starting with `\"inputInt\"` might be designed to accept integer input, while those starting with `\"inputFloat\"` might be intended for floating-point numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Documentation or Comments** : Well-documented code typically includes comments or documentation strings that describe the purpose and usage of functions. By referring to the documentation or comments associated with `inputInt()` and `inputFloat()` , you should be able to determine which one to use based on the expected input type.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **Function Behavior** : If you have access to the source code or documentation, examining the behavior of the functions can also help you distinguish between them. For example, `inputInt()` might specifically prompt the user for an integer input and throw an error if a non-integer value is provided, while `inputFloat()` could accept both integer and floating-point inputs without throwing any errors."
