        "Answer 1 - \n",
        "\n",
        "Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Modularity and Reusability**: Functions allow you to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units of code. This promotes modularity, making your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. Functions can be reused in different parts of the program or in other programs, saving time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Code Organization**: Functions provide a structured way to organize your code. By encapsulating specific functionality within functions, you can improve code readability and maintainability. Functions also help in isolating and troubleshooting issues since you can focus on specific parts of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Abstraction and Encapsulation**: Functions allow you to abstract away implementation details. By defining a function with a meaningful name and input/output parameters, you can hide the internal workings of the function and focus on its purpose. This abstraction makes your code more understandable and reduces complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **Code Reusability and Scalability**: Functions can be used to create libraries of reusable code. Once you define a function, you can call it multiple times with different inputs. This reusability saves effort and promotes code scalability. Functions also enable collaborative development, as different team members can work on separate functions and then integrate them into the larger program.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) **Code Readability and Maintainability**: Functions enhance code readability by providing a logical structure and meaningful names for tasks. They make code more self-explanatory and easier to understand, especially if well-documented. Additionally, functions simplify maintenance as you can update or fix a specific function without affecting other parts of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) **Testing and Debugging**: Functions enable isolated testing and debugging. You can write unit tests for individual functions to verify their correctness. If a bug is encountered, functions help narrow down the problematic area, making it easier to identify and fix issues."
