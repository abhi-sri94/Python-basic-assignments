        "\n",
        "1)  Starting Character: In most programming languages, variable names cannot begin with a number. They usually need to start with a letter or an underscore (_). This rule is in place to distinguish between variable names and numerical values. Since 'eggs' starts with a letter, it follows this rule and is considered a valid variable name.\n",

While 'eggs' adheres to these conventions, 100 does not, as it starts with a number.\n",
