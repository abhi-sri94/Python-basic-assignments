The **`\"re\"`** module provides functions and methods for working with regular expressions. To create a Regex object, you typically use the `re.compile()` function, which `compiles` a `regular` expression pattern into a `Regex` object that can be used for matching and manipulating strings."

        "Raw strings, denoted by prefixing a string with the letter **'r'** (e.g., r\"pattern\"), are commonly used in Python regular expressions (regex) to avoid unwanted character escapes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular expressions contain special characters with specific meanings, such as backslashes `(\\)` or certain combinations of characters. These special characters are used to define patterns and match specific sequences of characters. However, in Python strings, backslashes have their own meaning as escape characters, allowing you to include special characters like newline `(\\n)` or tab `(\\t)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "When constructing regular expressions, it is often necessary to use backslashes for special characters, such as matching a literal backslash or specifying word boundaries. However, using regular Python strings would require escaping backslashes with additional backslashes, resulting in more complex and harder-to-read patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using raw strings, you can treat backslashes as literal characters, without the need for escaping. This is particularly useful when working with regular expressions because they often contain a significant number of backslashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider the regex pattern `\"\\d+\"` , which matches one or more digits. To use this pattern as a regular Python string, you would need to escape the backslash: `\"\\\\d+\"` . However, by using a raw string, you can write it as `r\"\\d+\"` , simplifying the pattern and making it more readable."

        "\n",
        "Passing **re.VERBOSE** as the second argument to `re.compile()` in Python allows you to use verbose mode in regular expressions. Verbose mode enables you to write more readable and organized regular expressions by allowing you to add comments and whitespace to the pattern without affecting its functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's what passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument enables you to do:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Add Comments** : You can add comments within the regular expression pattern using the # symbol. These comments are ignored by the regex engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Add Whitespace** : You can add whitespace `(spaces, tabs, newlines)` within the regular expression pattern. This helps improve readability by allowing you to format the pattern across multiple lines and indent it as needed.\n",

        "3) **Ignore Whitespace** : Whitespace within character classes `([])` and escaped whitespace `(\\)` is not ignored. Only whitespace outside of these constructs is ignored.\n",
