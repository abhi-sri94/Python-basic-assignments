        "Answer 8 -\n",
        "\n",
        "Using logging messages instead of print() statements offers several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Granular control over log levels** : The logging module provides different levels of logging, allowing you to categorize and filter messages based on their severity. With `print()` , it's more challenging to differentiate between different levels of importance or selectively display messages based on their significance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Flexible output destinations** : The logging module allows you to configure the output destination of log messages. You can direct messages to a file, the console, or even remote logging services. This flexibility makes it easier to manage and analyze logs in various environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Runtime enable/disable capability** : By configuring the log level, you can easily enable or disable logging messages without modifying the code. This can be particularly useful when deploying code to different environments or when troubleshooting specific issues. With print(), you would need to manually remove or comment out the print() statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **Structured logging and formatting options** : The logging module provides formatting options to structure log messages with timestamps, log levels, and other contextual information. You can customize log message formats and easily add additional details to facilitate debugging and analysis. print() statements lack this flexibility and require manual formatting for similar effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) **Integration with existing logging infrastructure** : The logging module integrates well with other logging frameworks and tools. It aligns with established logging practices and can be easily integrated into larger logging setups or third-party services for centralized log management and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) **Performance and efficiency** : Logging messages can be more efficient than print() statements, especially when logging is disabled or set to higher log levels. In such cases, the logging module incurs minimal performance overhead. In contrast, print() statements are executed regardless of the program's logging configuration, potentially impacting performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) **Debugging and maintenance** : Logging messages provide a consistent approach to tracking program execution and troubleshooting issues. They allow for better long-term maintainability by providing a historical record of events and the ability to easily enable detailed logging when investigating problems."

        "The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in a debugger are used to control the execution flow while debugging code. Here are the differences between these buttons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Step Over** : The Step Over button allows you to execute the current line of code and move to the next line in a single step. If the current line contains a function call, the Step Over command will execute the entire function and return to the next line in the calling code. It is useful when you want to skip the detailed execution of function internals and focus on the higher-level code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Step In** : The Step In button allows you to enter into the execution of a function call. If the current line contains a function call, the Step In command will move the debugger to the first line inside the function being called. This allows you to step through the function's execution line by line, inspecting variables and following the control flow within the function. It is useful when you want to dive into the details of a particular function to understand its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Step Out** : The Step Out button allows you to quickly execute the remaining lines of the current function and return to the line that called the function. If you are already inside a function, the Step Out command will continue executing the function until it reaches the line where the function was called. It is useful when you are inside a function and want to quickly return to the calling code without stepping through all the remaining lines of the function."

        "\n",
        "2) **Exception** : If an unhandled exception occurs during the program execution, the debugger will stop when the exception is raised. This allows you to examine the stack trace and the state of the program at the point of the exception.\n",

        "3) **End of program** : The debugger will stop when the program execution completes and reaches the end of the code. At this point, you can review the final state of variables and any output or results produced by the program."

        "A breakpoint is a debugging feature that allows you to pause the execution of a program at a specific line of code. When a breakpoint is set, the debugger will stop the program's execution when it reaches that line, giving you an opportunity to examine the program's state, variables, and step through the code line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few key aspects of breakpoints:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Setting a breakpoint** : Breakpoints can be set using a debugger's graphical user interface `(GUI)` or by inserting specific debugging statements or directives in the code. Most modern integrated development environments `(IDEs)` provide a visual interface to set breakpoints by clicking on the line numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Pausing program execution** : When the program reaches a breakpoint during execution, the debugger interrupts the execution and enters a debugging mode. At this point, you can inspect the current values of variables, evaluate expressions, and step through the code to analyze its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Stepping through code** : Once the program is paused at a breakpoint, you have the option to step through the code line by line. This allows you to observe the program's execution flow, step into function calls to examine their behavior, step over lines to skip detailed internal execution, or step out of a function to quickly return to the calling code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **Conditional breakpoints** : Some debuggers support conditional breakpoints, which allow you to specify a condition that determines whether the breakpoint is triggered. The program will pause only if the condition evaluates to true, providing more fine-grained control over when and where the debugger stops."
